**Datable**, is a school resource management system developed as an ICT SBA (School-Based Assessment) project. Datable is designed for the student union's material borrowing and returning management, aiming to solve the problems found in daily operations and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of daily operations.  By developing a material borrowing and returning registration system, it is possible to effectively manage and monitor the school's various assets. This paper proposes a feasible database management system prototype, covering the main functions and design considerations of the system. First, the system requirements are analyzed, and the corresponding entity-relationship diagram is completed. Next, the implementation of data privacy and important SQL statements for providing statistical data are discussed. Finally, this paper provides specific explanations on the testing and evaluation of the system prototype, including the pros and cons of database design, the concepts of relational databases, as well as important issues such as data validation and validity checking. The entire project aims to provide a practical material borrowing and returning registration system solution for middle school student unions.

This provides a natural-language interface to your database's general-purpose capabilities:

- Edit any data in database with AI.
- Auto execute SQL to complete all your request with AI in one time.
- Analyze and gain insight from AI.
- ...etc.

> The classic work page adopts the same style as a whole. The yellow background is decorated with black embellishment, and the two-tone website design with a simple interface is adopted. Reasonable typesetting and clear classification of functional blocks for the convenience of users. It provides a beautiful and consistent user experience.

![poster](https://github.com/MikeChan-HK/Datable/blob/main/github_poster/assistant_page.jpeg)
> AI technology is used to perform SQL operations for users with artificial intelligence assistants. Users can query tables, add data, change data tables and other detailed operations. For example, the user asks the artificial intelligence assistant, ”Find the loan status of the object 001. If it has not been lent, please register as user 001 has been borrowed, but if the object has been borrowed, please register the object status as not been loaned, and then find the object that the user 001 has borrowed“. The artificial intelligence assistant will ask you. Whether you want to perform the operation, and then it will run.
