# Datable 
Datable, is a school resource management system developed as an ICT SBA (School-Based Assessment) project. Datable is designed for the student union's material borrowing and returning management, aiming to solve the problems found in daily operations and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of daily operations.  By developing a material borrowing and returning registration system, it is possible to effectively manage and monitor the school's various assets. This paper proposes a feasible database management system prototype, covering the main functions and design considerations of the system. First, the system requirements are analyzed, and the corresponding entity-relationship diagram is completed. Next, the implementation of data privacy and important SQL statements for providing statistical data are discussed. Finally, this paper provides specific explanations on the testing and evaluation of the system prototype, including the pros and cons of database design, the concepts of relational databases, as well as important issues such as data validation and validity checking. The entire project aims to provide a practical material borrowing and returning registration system solution for middle school student unions.

# Why
As school assets continue to increase, how to effectively manage and monitor these assets has become an important issue faced by student unions. In the past, various items in the school such as furniture and electronic equipment lacked systematic management, making it difficult to grasp the borrowing situation and maintenance status of the items. Sometimes, items may even be lost or damaged, resulting in unnecessary waste. Traditional manual registration methods are not only inefficient but also prone to omissions and errors, and lack systematic data management. To solve this problem, I decided to develop a dedicated material borrowing and returning registration system for the student union, improving the utilization efficiency of school assets through data management.

# Introducing Datable
These days, managing database means navigating an endless sea of complexity. I felt this pain at my experience, so I designed Datable, an experimental initiative aimed at bringing your entire workflow to work with ai. Datable starts with a web-based workspace that'll feel familiar for database but fresh.
